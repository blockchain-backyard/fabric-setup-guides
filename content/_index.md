# Fabric Setup Guides

This is the set of missing guides for Fabric setup.

[Hyperledger Fabric](https://www.hyperledger.org/projects/fabric) is a permissioned blockchain framework implementation. Intended as a foundation for developing applications or solutions with a modular architecture, Hyperledger Fabric allows components, such as consensus and membership services, to be plug-and-play.

First of all we assume you have done 1 or more of the following:

1. [Built your First Network](http://hyperledger-fabric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/build_network.html)
2. Tried the [Marbles](https://github.com/IBM-Blockchain/marbles) Demo.
3. Gone through one of [these](https://www.hyperledger.org/resources/training) courses.

Now, this is where our guides come in. These are level 2 guides that follow these basic ones and try to solve common patterns people wish to try at this stage.
